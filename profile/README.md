# SMAPVEX19-22 Repository (living document)

## Background 

Validated retrieval of forest soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) is one of the long-standing unresolved issues hindering the advances in hydrology, ecology, and understanding of the Earth system. The fundamental reason for the lack of progress is the lack of adequate reference data in forested areas; to close this gap, NASAâ€™s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, with its partners, conducted a field experiment in temperate forests of northeast USA, named the SMAP Validation Experiment 2019-2022 (SMAPVEX19-22). The primary objective of SMAPVEX19-22 was to improve the SM and VOD retrievals in forested areas. It incorporated a comprehensive measurement regime to characterize SM in the top layers of soil, surface conditions, and vegetation.
